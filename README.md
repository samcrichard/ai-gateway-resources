# AI Gateway Resources

A comprehensive guide to AI gateways and unified LLM API platforms for developers. Compare top AI gateway solutions, explore integration examples, and simplify your multi-model LLM infrastructure.

## What Is an AI Gateway?

An **AI gateway** (also called an **LLM gateway** or **LLM proxy**) is a unified API layer that sits between your application and multiple large language model providers. Instead of integrating separately with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and others, an AI gateway provides a single endpoint to access all of them.

**Key benefits of using an AI gateway:**

- **Unified API** — One SDK and consistent request format across all LLM providers
- **Model Fallbacks** — Automatically route to backup models when primary providers fail
- **Cost Optimization** — Compare pricing and route requests to the most cost-effective LLM
- **Load Balancing** — Distribute traffic across providers to avoid rate limits
- **Observability** — Centralized logging, monitoring, and analytics for all LLM calls
- **Caching** — Reduce costs and latency with semantic caching of responses

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key="your-openrouter-api-key",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="google/gemini-3-flash-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "How do I integrate OpenRouter with my Python application?"}
    ]

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929'),
  prompt: 'How do I integrate the Vercel AI SDK with Next.js?',
});

console.log(text);
```
